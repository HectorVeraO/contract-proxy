Contract hub is a contract with the following features:
1. Mutable set of FacetInterfaces (polymorphism)
2. Incrementable set of managed contracts
3. Mutable set of allowed interfaces for managed contracts
4. Can deploy managed contracts (might be doable with mload mstore and create / create2)
5. Allows interactions with managed contracts (for now managed contracts will behave
   as "facets" of the hub which means the managed contracts have the state within the hub
   so the hub just "borrows" their behaviour but maybe they should be responsible for their state)
